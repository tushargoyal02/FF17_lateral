Q1 Take an input from the user and check the data based on the following condition
 - The data should be of string data type
 - The length of the input should lie in the range from 6 to 15 character in length
- The input should have atleast 1 capital letter ( A to Z)
- 1 smaller letter ( A to J)
- 1 Number ( 0 to 9)
- 1 Special character (  # @ $  %)

In case any of the condition is not valid ask for the input from the user upto 4 times otherwise exit the program by putting a message input give is wrong

[NOTE : We don't have to use any input library or using any regular expression or re or no isnumberic() or isalphabat() like this or upper lower method]

char in ['A','B','C']
char in "ABCDEFGHI"
]

Q9 Check the input string provided by the user, in case the string provied is starting with the vowel we add on "ing" in the last
	otherwise we add on "esy" in the end of the string
